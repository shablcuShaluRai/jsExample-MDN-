//1. creating an array using array literal

// JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
// An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.
  var breakfast = ["coffee","tea","bread","chapati"];
  console.log(breakfast);

// javascript also contains different type of value in the same variable.
 var hodgePodge = [100,"paint",[200, "brush"],false];
 console.log(hodgePodge);


// 2. creating an array using new keyword.
 var cars = new Array("Sab","volvo","BMW");
  console.log(cars);
